# Perceptron and Adaline from Scratch

This project implements two classic machine learning algorithms — **Perceptron** and **Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron)** — entirely from scratch using NumPy. It includes both batch and stochastic gradient descent versions of Adaline.

## Features

- Perceptron classifier
- Adaline with batch gradient descent
- Adaline with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Manual weight updates and loss tracking
- Decision boundary and loss curve visualization
- Training on a binary subset of the Iris dataset

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for dataset loading only)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptron-adaline-from-scratch.git
cd perceptron-adaline-from-scratch
